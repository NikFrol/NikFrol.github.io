        <h4>Flacon-magazine</h4>
        Employment type: Contract
        Role: Frontend Web Developer
        Jun 2022 - Sep 2022 · 4 mos
        <p>
          Flacon fashion and beauty magazine. With an audience of over 10,000 people a day
          website: flacon-magazine.com

          I built a website for a fashion magazine based on an existing platform. The tech stack I utilized included
          REST API, Apollo GraphQL, TypeScript, and React components.

          In my role as a frontend programmer, I collaborated closely with the magazine's design team, editors, and
          owners. I received tasks from them and worked closely to understand the project requirements. We engaged in
          discussions to establish realistic timelines and ensure the quality of work aligned with their expectations.

          Using my expertise in frontend development, I leveraged the REST API and Apollo GraphQL to fetch data and
          handle server-side communication efficiently. TypeScript allowed me to write type-safe code, minimizing errors
          and enhancing code maintainability. By utilizing React components, I created reusable and modular UI elements
          that enhanced the user experience.

          I took pride in effectively translating design concepts into fully functional websites. Throughout the
          development process, I proactively sought clarifications and provided updates to the design team, editors, and
          owners.

          In this role, I was responsible for training and mentoring a team of six frontend developers. The technology
          stack we worked with included Angular, React, TypeScript, and REST API.

          As part of my responsibilities, I conducted training sessions to enhance the skills of the frontend
          development team. These sessions covered various topics, including design patterns, web development best
          practices, and algorithms for search and sorting. I leveraged my expertise and industry experience to provide
          valuable insights and practical knowledge to the team members.

          In addition to training, I also organized educational lectures to share in-depth knowledge on specific topics
          related to frontend development. These lectures aimed to improve the team's understanding of advanced concepts
          and emerging trends in the field. I ensured that the lectures were engaging and interactive, fostering a
          collaborative learning environment.

          Furthermore, I played a vital role in assessing the skill levels of the frontend developers. I conducted
          examinations to evaluate their proficiency and knowledge in the respective technologies. Based on the results,
          I provided individual feedback and recommendations to help each team member enhance their qualifications and
          reach their full potential.

          Throughout my tenure, I prioritized effective communication and teamwork. I encouraged an open dialogue among
          team members, fostering a supportive and collaborative atmosphere. I actively listened to their concerns,
          provided guidance, and offered solutions to challenges they encountered.

          By sharing my expertise, conducting examinations, and providing personalized recommendations, I aimed to
          contribute to the professional growth and success of each team member. I take pride in seeing them excel in
          their roles and deliver high-quality frontend solutions.
